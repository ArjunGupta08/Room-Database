# Simple Room Database

Room Database can be implemented in 5 steps -



	1) Entities (Tables)

	2) Dao

	3) Database

	4) Type-Converters

	5) Migration



You can achieve room database by just doing upper top 3 steps but in the manner of enhancing the database you should follow the other 2 steps as well.



Step 1 - Create an data class and annotate it as @Entity and define a tableName =  "xyz" . 

Note - We will use this `table name` in next step.

data class example -





    @Entity(tableName = "contact")

    data class Contact(    

      @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)    

      val id:Long,    

      val name:String,    

      val phone:String,    
  
      val createdDate:Date,   

      val isActive : Int

    )
